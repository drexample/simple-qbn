# State

One of the requirements of using QBN structures is the tracking of qualities, values storied outside of a storylet. In SimpleQBN, this is **State**. It is a **Map()** of values that can be added, removed, changed, or retrieved.

**State** is used when creating a **Deck** and is source of tracking the measurements of qualities within the structure.
