# SimpleQBN (0.5.0 - beta)

*Because nothing about quality-based narratives is actually simple.*

SimpleQBN is a quality-based narrative (QBN) generic framework. While it draws heavily from metaphors and expression operators defined in [TinyQBN](https://github.com/JoshuaGrams/tiny-qbn), it is not tied to a particular story format or even usage with Twine 2.
